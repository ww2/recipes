    <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
      <p>Melt the butter, so it can start cooling.</p>
      <p>Place a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 375ÂºF.</p>
      <p>Line each well in a muffin tin with a parchment muffin cup.</p>
      <p>Sift flour, cocoa, baking powder, and baking soda into a large bowl.</p>
      <p>Whisk in the salt.<p>
      <p>Stir in the the chocolate chips.</p>
      <p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the sugar, buttermilk, eggs, vanilla extract, and melted butter.</p>
      <p>Add the wet ingredients to the dry and stir until just combined using a large rubber or silicone spatula. Resist the urgeto mix it smooth.</p>
      <p>Using a spoon, drop the batter into the prepared cups.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>If the eggs aren't at room temperature, and/or the butter still seems warm,
            whisk the butter into the liquids last, and add it slowly to prevent the
            eggs from cooking.</li>
        <li>Last time I made mini-muffins, they took 9:30 to bake, and there was enough batter
            left over to make 7 full-sized muffins.  Last time I made full-sized muffins, they
            took 18 minutes to bake, and there were 14.</li>
