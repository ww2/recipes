    <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
      <p>Grease a 10-cup-capacity Bundt pan, and dust with superfine/caster sugar.</p>
      <p>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.</p>
      <p>In microwave oven or double boiler over simmering water, melt chocolate. Let cool.</p>
      <p>Put espresso and cocoa powders in a 2-cup (or larger) heatproof glass measuring cup.</p>
      <p>Add enough simmering water to come up to the 1 cup measuring line. Whisk until powders dissolve.</p>
      <p>Add whiskey and salt; let cool.</p>
      <p>In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to beat softened butter until fluffy.</p>
      <p>Add sugar and beat until well combined.</p>
      <p>Beat in the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition.</p>
      <p>Beat in the vanilla extract, baking soda and melted chocolate, scraping down sides of bowl with a rubber spatula.</p>
      <p>On lowest speed, beat in a third of the whiskey mixture, dribbling it in slowly to avoid cooking the eggs.</p>
      <p>When liquid is absorbed, beat in half of the flour.</p>
      <p>Repeat additions, ending with whiskey mixture.</p>
      <p>Pour batter into prepared pan, banging the pan against the counter to get rid of the largest bubbles.</p>
      <p>Bake until a cake tester inserted into center of cake comes out clean, about 1 hour 10 minutes.</p>
      <p>Transfer cake pan to a cooling rack.</p>
      <p>Unmold after 15 minutes, optionally garnishing with confectioners' sugar before serving.</p>
