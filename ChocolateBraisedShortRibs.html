    <h3 class="subhead">Directions</h3>
    <div itemprop="recipeInstructions" class="directions text">
      <p>Render out the oil from the bacon, remove and reserve the bacon.</p>
      <p>Thoroughly salt and pepper the ribs, brown them on all sides, over med-high heat.</p>
      <p>Turn down the heat to a low/simmer, and add the onion and a pinch of salt; saute for 5 minutes or so, until onion soft and translucent.</p>
      <p>Add garlic, saute for about 30 seconds -- don't overcook or brown.</p>
      <p>Add (2 tbsp) all-purpose flour, cook for 2 minutes to make a roux.</p>
      <p>Add 1 cup of dry sherry, stir it in and deglaze the bottom, bring that up to a simmer and add the bacon, browned short ribs (bone side up), 1 qt. beef stock (mostly cover them), bay leaves, thyme -- everything but chocolate and cinnamon.</p>
      <p>Simmer for 1.5 hours, covered, start counting when you just start seeing bubbles.</p>
      <p>Add the chocolate (broken up in small pieces) and cinnamon, stir until chocolate melts.</p>
      <p>Put the lid back on, let it go for 30 more minutes.</p>
      <p>Let it cool; put it in the fridge overnight.</p>
      <p>Next day, while it's still cold, scoop the fat off of the top.</p>
      <p>Heat everything for 15 to 20 minutes over a low heat.</p>
      <p>Remove the ribs.</p>
      <p>Add a little bit more dark chocolate and a dash more cinnamon, and simmer the sauce until its volume reduces by about half.</p>
      <p>Restore the ribs to the reduced sauce, and serve them with the sauce once they're rewarmed to your satisfaction.</p>

      <p>Warning: to make this properly, the you need two steps with an overnight pause between them:
        <li>Day 1, you braise the meat, and then refrigerate it in the sauce overnight.</li>
        <li>Day 2, you lift all the solidified fat off of the top of the sauce, then reheat and serve.</li>
